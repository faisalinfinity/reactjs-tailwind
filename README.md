- Protected routes
- Responsive dashboard
- User profile management
- Application settings
- Tailwind CSS for styling

   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

```

## Main Components

- `App.tsx`: The main component that sets up routing for the application.
- `Dashboard.tsx`: The layout component that wraps authenticated pages.
- `LoginPage.tsx`: Handles user login.
- `ProtectedRoute.tsx`: A wrapper component that ensures routes are only accessible to authenticated users.

## Authentication

This project uses a simple authentication mechanism with localStorage for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should implement a more secure authentication system, possibly using JWT tokens and secure backend APIs.

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The styles are applied directly in the components using Tailwind's utility classes.

## Form Handling

Formik is used for form management and validation, along with Yup for schema validation.
